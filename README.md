# <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

This is the implementation of two **polarity propagation algorithms** [[1]](#epia2011) 
[[2]](#propor2011) in Java. 
These algorithms allows us to classify a set of *words*, *multiwords* and *synsets* 
as `positive`, `negative` and `neutral` starting with a small set of those items.

This implementation can be run from the **command line** and through a **Java API**.
In both cases it is required as input:

- **A set of seed items**. This is an initial set of *words*, *multiwords*, or *synsets* 
classified as `positive` and `negative` (and optionally as `neutral`);
- **A set of relations between items**. This is set of **synonyms** and **antonymys** 
(optional) *words*, *multiwords* or *synsets* that we want to classify. These 
relations are used to build a graph.

The implementation will output:
- A list of items classified as `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`, `ambiguous`, and `unknown`.

### <a name="intro-example"></a>Example

This example tries to explain the mentioned concepts. Suppose that our goal is 
to classify a set of words as `positive`, `negative` and `neutral` with a few effort.

- First, we collect a bunch of *synonyms* and *antonyms* words from a 
*dictionary*, *thesaurus* or *wordnet*. Then, we represent them as a graph. 
Suposse that we collected the words shown in the following **undirect graph**.
In this graph, a *dashed line* represents an **antonym** and a *solid line*
represents a **synonym**. Note that this is a *disconnected graph*.

![tiny-undirected-graph-of-english-words](/docs/figures/ex01-undirected-graph-state-01.png)

- Second, we manually classified the words **good** as `positive`, **bad** as `negative`, 
and **common** as `neutral`. This is shown in the following figure.

![tiny-undirected-graph-of-english-words](/docs/figures/ex01-undirected-graph-state-02.png)

- Finally, by applying a **polarity propagation algorithm** we can automatically 
classify the remaining words. The result is the following graph.

![tiny-undirected-graph-of-english-words](/docs/figures/ex01-undirected-graph-state-03.png)

As shown above, the result is a list of words classified as `positive` (green nodes), 
`negative` (red nodes), `neutral` (gray nodes).

Some observations:
- In some cases we can end up with words classified also as `ambiguous` 
(words with more than one polarity and `unknown` (words with polarity not set). 
The latter happens with all nodes that are not connected to a classified node.
- Generally, the smaller the distance between a non seed words and the closest seed 
word greater the probability of that word being correctly classified.


# <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

For running the application the following software must be installed:
- `JRE (Java Runtime Environmen) 1.6` or higher;
- Or `JDK (Java Development Kit)` 1.6 or higher.

# <a name="command-line"></a>Running in Command Line

The application can be run from the command line, by running:

```
java -jar <path-to-the-application-jar> {mandatory-options} [optional-options]
```

**Options:**

| Option         | Type 	  | Description
| -------------- | ---------- | -----------
| -h             | optional   | help
| -s &lt;file_name&gt; | mandatory  | Seed words file name
| -g &lt;file_name&gt; | mandatory  | Graph file name
| -o &lt;file_name&gt; | optional   | Output file name
| -e encoding    | optional   | Caracter encoding of all the files

### <a name="command-line-example"></a>Example

This example, shows how to reproduce the previous example in the command line, to
classify a set of words as `positive`, `negative` and `neutral`. 

- First, we create a file with the word **good** classified as `positive`, **bad** 
classified as `negative`, and the word **common** classified as `neutral`. 
This file is saved as [examples/01-tiny-graph-english/seed-words-utf8.csv](examples/01-tiny-graph-english/seed-words-utf8.csv).
File content:

```
good,1
bad,-1
common,0
```

- Then, we create a graph file and save it as [examples/01-tiny-graph-english/graph-edges-utf8.txt](examples/01-tiny-graph-english/graph-edges-utf8.txt). 
Sample of this file:

```
good SYN firm
good SYN hard
good SYN informed
good SYN just
good ANT bad
bad SYN bastard
bad SYN bush
bad SYN bush-league
bad SYN crummy
(...)
```

- Finally, we run the following command line:

```
java -jar polarity-propagation-0.6.0.jar -s "examples/01-tiny-graph-english/seed-words-utf8.csv" -g "examples/01-tiny-graph-english/graph-edges-utf8.txt" -e "utf-8" -o "examples/01-tiny-graph-english/dic-output.csv"
```

The application will output a list of words classified with their polarity, 
to the file [examples/01-tiny-graph-english/dic-output.csv](examples/01-tiny-graph-english/dic-output.csv). 
A sample of the **outputted csv file**, is the following:

```
words,polarity,negativeCounter,neutralCounter,positiveCounter,iteration
good,+,0,0,1,0
commonsense,+,1,0,0,1
commonsensible,+,0,0,1,1
commonsensical,+,0,0,1,1
firm,+,0,0,1,1
hard,+,0,0,1,1
(...)
well-founded,+,0,0,3,1
groundless,-,1,0,0,1
illogical,-,3,0,0,1
invalid,-,3,0,0,1
irrational,-,3,0,0,1
(...)
weak,-,2,0,0,2
fairish,+,0,0,1,2
serviceable,+,0,0,1,2
deficient,-,1,0,0,2
inadequate,-,1,0,0,2
insufficient,-,1,0,0,2
lacking,-,1,0,0,2
```

# <a name="java-api"></a>Running through the Java API

The application can be called through a Java API. The previous example and previous
command line can be reproduced by the following Java code:

```java
// Read the graph from a file
TriplesLoader loader = new TriplesLoader();
SimpleGraph<Word, LexicalRelation> initialGraph 
		= loader.load(
		 new File("examples/01-tiny-graph-english/graph-edges-utf8.txt")
		, "utf-8");

// Read the seed words from a file
SeedWordsLoader seedWordsLoader = new SeedWordsLoader(); 
List<Word> seedWords = seedWordsLoader.load(
		 new File("examples/01-tiny-graph-english/seed-words-utf8.csv")
		, "utf-8");

// Propagate the polarity from the seed words to the remaining words
SimpleGraph<Word, LexicalRelation> finalGraph = 
	PolarityPropagation.propagate(initialGraph, seedWords);

//	Write the list of words to a csv file
CsvOutput csv = new CsvOutput(new File("dic-output.csv"));
csv.write(finalGraph);          
```

# <a name="other-examples"></a>Other Examples

### <a name="other-examples-example1"></a>ExampleTinyDirectedGraph.java 

This example shows how to propagate the `positive` and `negative` over a tiny 
**directed graph** of synonyms and antonymys. This graph is shown below. In this
graph **A** is classified as `positive` and **B** as `negative` (graph shown on the *initial state*).

![tiny-directed-graph-of-letters-epia](/docs/figures/tiny-directed-graph-of-letters-epia.png)

After applying a propagation algorithm, we get the graph shown on its *final state*.
In this graph:
- `A, C, F` are classified as `positive`;
- `B, E, H, I` are classified as `negative`;
- `D, G` are classified as `ambiguous` (they are simultaneously `positive` and `negative`).

The full Java code to reproduce this is example is available on
[ExampleTinyDirectedGraph.java](src/pt/psantos/phd/polarity/propagation/examples/ExampleTinyDirectedGraph.java#L149).

This example is described in [[1]](#epia2011), on section **2.3 Intuitive and Simple 
Polarity Propagation - Algorithm**.

### <a name="other-examples-example2"></a>ExampleTinyUndirectedGraph.java

This example shows how to propagate the `positive`, `negative` and `neutral` 
polarity over a tiny **undirected graph** of synonyms. This graph is shown below. 
In this graph `0, 1` and `2` are classified as `positive`, `negative` and `neutral` 
respectively (graph shown on the *initial state*).

![tiny-undirected-graph-of-numbers-propor](/docs/figures/tiny-undirected-graph-of-numbers-propor.png)

After applying a propagation algorithm, we get the graph shown on its *final state*.
In this graph:
- `0, 6, 8, 9, 10` are classified as `positive`;
- `1, 4` are classified as `negative`;
- `2, 3` are classified as `neutral`;
- `5, 7` are classified as `ambiguous` (they are simultaneously positive and negative);
- `11, 12` end up with `no polarity`.
